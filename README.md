# VectorMaximumWorker
Recruitment Homework for C++ Engineers

send us code for a "worker" that can find the largest elements
of various input vectors. The input arrives on one thread, and
the answers will be read on another, and the work needs to be
done in a way that avoids the calculation being done on either
calling thread, but using a maximum number of worker threads.

A basic stub has been provided within the src folder.
